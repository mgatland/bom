tools used:
daisyUI on Tailwind
- https://daisyui.com/docs/utilities/
- https://tailwindcss.com/docs/

run both of these for development work:
> npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.css --watch
> npx http-server .

Add these parameters to the url to test things:
?restart
?cheats

Before release:
Look up 'tailwind purge', configure tailwind to purge unused classes

Notes:
I turned off 'github.copilot.editor.enableCodeActions' because the ✨ UI was so annoying ✨
